This add-on allows you to read and activate icons on the system tray or the
task bar, within a list box, for easy access and interaction to those
items. With the add-on installed, press NVDA+f11 once for this dialog to
pop-up with system tray elements, and press twice to display task bar
elements, which are the currently running applications.

Note that you can access the windows system tray in any screen reader
software using the Windows+B, and the task bar by pressing Windows+T. This
plugin is only useful to make the transition from JAWS for Windows smoother
and to avoid some tooltips that may pop-up when cycling through the system
tray with the windows keyboard means.
